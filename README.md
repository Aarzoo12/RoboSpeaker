# RoboSpeaker
The "Robo Speaker" project is a Python-based application that leverages text-to-speech (TTS) technology to transform written text into spoken words. 
 It essentially acts as a virtual speech synthesizer, allowing users to input any text, and then generating audible output in a natural, human-like voice. The project provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the TTS functionality, making it accessible to a wide range of users.
